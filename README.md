# sentiment-project
 Still in progress!

 The idea of a program that takes audio files as an input and with the help
 of speech recognition we change that into text.
 From there, we make an assumption of the mood of the user.

# Future Plans
- Add the microphone as an input.
- Make suggestions (activities) to the user based on their mood.
- Implement an online feature to help people with the same accepted activities
to talk over the app for a potential group activities.
